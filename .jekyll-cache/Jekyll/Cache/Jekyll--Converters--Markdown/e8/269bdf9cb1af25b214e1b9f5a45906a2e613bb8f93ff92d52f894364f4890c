I"—<p>For my <a href="/blog/2015/04/26/slides/">talk at the Extensible Web Summit</a> I had limiited time because I had put off working on it until the last minute. I also wanted to run and pause javascript in the slides and because of these constraints, I figured it would be quicker to roll my own solution than to use a pre-existing presentation framework such as <a href="https://slid.es">slid.es</a>.</p>
