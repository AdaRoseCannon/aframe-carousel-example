I"l<p>A major Science Fiction blockbuster, in a Franchise I am a big fan of, hit cinemas a short while ago.
In a furore of brand fan-girl-ism and being unable to afford to buy a Force-Effect lightsabre of my own, I did what any reasonable developer would do and I built my own.
This was a quick one afternoon project and I wanted to break down what went into it.</p>
